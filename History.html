<ul><p>The AORD was established in 2001 and is one of the largest dog welfare charity in Mauritius.<br>
We began our work by launching our successful shelter at Lallmatie. We now employ an Education & Community Team of 6 who deliver free workshops 
to primary schools, secondary schools and in the local community. These workshops educate people on safe behaviour around dogs and responsible dog ownership. 
To date, the team have delivered over 350 workshops, reaching around 30,000 people. AORD believe that by educating the public we can make a positive impact 
on the lives of dogs across the country, by teaching people how to better understand their dogâ€™s needs and how to behave safely and responsibly around dogs.
 <br><br>

We then launched our nationwide Subsidised Neutering scheme, enabling people in receipt of means tested Social Welfare payments to have their dogs neutered 
and microchipped at a reduced cost. Since the start of the campaign, over 125,000 dogs have been neutered through this scheme.<br><br>

We rescue dogs from a variety of sources, working closely with local authority pounds and like-minded animal welfare charities across the country.
 We have rehomed over 5,000 dogs and puppies to their Forever Homes, and we now employ upwards of 20 members of staff along with a fantastic team of volunteers.<br><br>

In 2017, we created our own website to raise more awareness of AORD. We have a special feature where people  can share their location whenever a dog in need 
is spotted. This new feature allows us to rescue additional puppies each year, along with their mothers.<br><br>

We have hundreds of puppies and dogs of all shapes, sizes, colours, and breeds in our care, looking for their special someone. 
All puppies and dogs in our rehoming centre are sterilised, microchipped, fully vaccinated and have their temperament assessed 
before going to their Forever Home. AORD does not receive any Government funding towards our life saving work, so none of this
 would be possible without the continued commitment and generosity of our donors and supporters. We simply could not continue our efforts without them.<br><br>

Our mission is to bring about the day when all dogs can enjoy a happy life free from the threat of unnecessary destruction.</p><ul>
