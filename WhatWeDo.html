      <p>We take in and rehome dogs as helping vulnerable dogs is our number one priority.
We also take in dogs from individuals, for all sorts of reasons: from changes in accommodation and finances, to relationship breakdowns and family crises.
Our vet team works 6 days a week providing veterinary care and lifesaving surgeries.</p>
