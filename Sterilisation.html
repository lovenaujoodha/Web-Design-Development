<br><ul><p style="font-family:Courier New; font-size:20px">Sterilisation is a surgical procedure in which a part of your pet's reproductive organ is removed to 
permanently stop it from reproducing. Sterilisation is done mostly on male and female dogs. For male animals, the testicles are removed, and this procedure is 
commonly known as castration.

<h2 style="font-size:27px">Importance of Sterilisation of a dog.</h2>

<p style="font-family:Courier New; font-size:20px">Sterilization has many benefits, including improving the health of your animals, reducing undesirable 
behaviors, and preventing unwanted animals.
<br><br>
First and foremost, sterilizing your pet will help them live a longer and healthier life. Spaying and neutering reduces, or can even eliminate, a number of 
health problems that are difficult and/or expensive to treat. By neutering your male animals, you help prevent testicular cancer and prostate problems. 
Spaying helps prevent uterine infections and breast tumors in your female animals.
<br><br>
Sterilization can help change unwanted behavior from your animals. For example, some aggression problems in male animals can be avoided by early neutering. 
Your male dog will be less likely to roam away from your home, preventing potential accidents from cars or fights with other males. Unneutered dogs will be 
less likely to mark their territory by spraying strong-smelling urine all over the house. They may be less likely to mount other dogs, people, and objects.
<br><br>
Finally, the impact of sterilizing your pets goes much further than your home. Spaying and neutering your individual pets helps your community by preventing 
the birth of unwanted animals. Communities and animal shelters spend millions of dollars to control unwanted dogs. Shelters are overburdened with animals, and 
some shelters euthanize their dogs after a certain time period to allow for more. Stray dogs can cause issues in your neighborhood by getting into 
trash, spreading diseases, and displaying potentially aggressive behavior.
<br><br>
The cost of your petâ€™s sterilization surgery is a lot less than having to care for a litter. Sterilization also costs much less than the cost of potential 
treatments from health complications in the future!</p>

<h3 style="font-size:27px">When to sterilize a dog?</h3>
<p style="font-family:Courier New; font-size:20px">Typically, owners sterilize their pups between six to nine months. However, puppies as young as eight weeks old can be neutered as long as they are healthy. 
Dogs can be sterilized as adults as well, although there may be more risk for post-operative complications in older dogs.
